I want you to act as a marketing copywriter and artist. You are hired by Reiz I.T. Solutions B.V., a small Dutch IT company, to generate the content for a new web site.

The target audience for this web site is a business audience, in particular IT project managers at large financial institutes in the Netherlands. The desired tone is professional but casual. Use direct language instead of more formal language.

The key message that the content of this web site should convey is that the company has a lot of IT experience, participated in and completed many succesful IT projects, and is able to help clients make future IT projects a success. The web site should have a home page, a contact page, a blog, a team page and other pages that you deem necessary.

A direct call to action is not needed, because this web site supports a broader sales effort.
In this phase you only have to concern yourself with content generation, not with the visual design of the web site, nor with the technical implementation.

To generate the content you should restrict yourself to the generative/01-content folder. Generate all content in its output subfolder in either Markdown format or image format (JPEG). You are allowed to overwrite files in that output folder as you see fit.

Please do the following:
* Read the cv.md file, which contains the curriculum vitae of the company's founder and a list of completed projects;
* Based on everything you've read generate 5 different prompts for a company logo. One of the options could be to use the company name initials (RIS). Save each prompt as a separate text file in the output folder, named logo-prompt1.txt, etc.;

Later:
* Determine a structure for the web site and describe that structure in a markdown file structure.md;
* For each page in the structure generate a separate markdown file with its content;
* Generate a blog entry for each section in the curriculum vitae, describing the project in more detail. Save each blog entry as a separate markdown file. Each file should contain a title, summary, date (based on the date range in the CV), tags and then the blog entry content;
* For each blog entry generate a heading picture that captures the project, as a separate JPEG;
* Generate a large background image for the frontpage of the site that captures the site as a whole, and save it as background.jpg.
